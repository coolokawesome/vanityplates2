# Canada Plates - Vanity Plate Customizer

Canada Plates is a license plate customizer that allows the user to create personalized vanity plates using all plates available in Canada!

### Description

Canada Plates is a single-page web application that provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to enter text and generate custom license plates using different Canadian province license plate designs. Users can choose their preferred province's license plate style and overlay their desired text on top. The website also includes a download button that allows users to save their customized license plates as images.

The second version of the Canada Plates application underwent a significant UI redesign and was built using React.js, instead of pure HTML and JavaScript (see version one <a href='https://coolokawesome.github.io/vanityPlates/'><u><b>here</b></u></a>). Recoil.js was utilized for state management, allowing efficient sharing of data between components. The development process involved revamping the UI with modern aesthetics, integrating Recoil.js for state management, and implementing modular components using React.js. Thorough testing and bug fixing were performed, followed by deployment to vercel (see deployment <a href="https://vercel.com"><u><b>here</b></u></a>). Continuous improvements were made based on user feedback and monitoring.
